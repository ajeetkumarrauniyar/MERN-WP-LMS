Book Store is a simple single page application (SPA) that lets you buy, rate and leave your comment for all the books that are available in the store. You can also see all of your purchased books history or create your own favorite books list.

# Technology Used :
Book Store uses a number of open source projects to work:

MongoDB - Free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database
Mongoose - Elegant MongoDB object modeling for NodeJS
NodeJS - Evented I/O for the backend
ExpressJS - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for NodeJS
JSONWebToken - Used for authorization
React JS - Platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web

# The goal of this project is to show the core concepts of building SPA with ExpressJS and Angular. In this project I've used:
- Wrapped each major feature into a module
- Lazy-loading for most of the modules so the app can start faster
- - Preload lazy-loaded modules after the app starts so they can be ready for use as soon as possible
- Shared module for components, directives and pipes that can be imported into any feature module
- Services for each major feature
- Guards to prevent unauthorized users to view routes that require authentication or admin rights
- Interceptors for attaching JWT token to the request headers, showing notifications from the server response and error handling
- Custom directives
- Custom pipes
- JavaScript models
- Reactive forms for handling user input
